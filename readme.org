*** Emacs major mode for Info format files.

The format is described [[http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/doc/html/boost_propertytree/parsers.html#boost_propertytree.parsers.info_parser][here]], but can be easily explained with an example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
; Comment
Key 0
KeyWithChildren {
    Child1 "String"
    Child2 {
        "StringKey" "Escaped \"Value\""
    }
}
#include "file.info"
#+END_EXAMPLE

This major mode is derived from conf-mode so many of the conf-mode features should work. The specific customizations for Info mode are:

- Syntax table, for navigation and font-lock highlighting
- Additional font-lock highlighting for keywords
- Limited indentation
